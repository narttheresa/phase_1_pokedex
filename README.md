# About

This project involved the utilisation of all HTML, CSS, JavaScript and implementing the use of the PokeAPI to fetch the first 151 Pokemons. The inspiration of the project came about the reminiscent memories of my early childhood years binge watching Pokemon every morning before school. 

# Features

- Searching and filtering through the list of 151 Pokemons with the given filtered options: Name, ID number of each pokemon, Pokemon types. 
- Based on user search input, the filtered result will display the selected Pokemon with the provided stats and description of the Pokemon

# Acknowledgement

I would like to give credit to the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/), for being able to use their database.
